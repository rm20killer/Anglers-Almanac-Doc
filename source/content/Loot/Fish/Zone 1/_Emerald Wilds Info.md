## Angler's Almanac concepts

### Emerald Trout
(**Inspiration**: Rainbow Trout)
- **Look:** Sleek, silver-bodied with dark "pepper" spots and a vibrant green horizontal band.

### Moss-Back Loach
(**Inspiration**: Weather Loach / Kuhli Loach)
- **Look:** A thick, tubular body that is mottled brown and green. In Hytale, the "Moss-Back" variant would have 3D "leafy" fins that look like actual clumps of moss to hide from predators.

### Grove Dart
(**Inspiration**: Neon Tetra)
- **Look:** A tiny, thin body with a "racing stripe" that flashes when it turns quickly.

# Zone 1 cave
Cave fish typically lose their pigment and become pale and their eyesight, but they develop incredible **bioluminescence** or enhanced whiskers to feel vibrations.
## Angler's Almanac concepts
### Blind Ghost Tetra
(**Inspiration**: Mexican Blind Cave Fish)
- **Look:** Using the same thin, tiny body as the **Grove Dart**, but the "racing stripe" is now a faint, pulsating lavender vein. The body is semi-translucent "ghost white," and the eyes are replaced by smooth, iridescent scales.
### Root-Feeler Loach
(**Inspiration**: Cave Loach)
- **Look:** Similar to the **Moss-Back Loach**, it has a thick, tubular body. Instead of "leafy" fins, it has long, thin, whip-like barbels that extend from its chin and fins to navigate in the dark. Its skin is a pale, fleshy pink with faint marble patterns.

### Abyssal Gem-Back
(**Inspiration**: Diamond Tetra)
- **Look:** A sleek body similar to the **Emerald Trout**. Instead of a green horizontal band, its spine is lined with jagged, crystalline protrusions that look like raw amethyst. Its body is deep slate grey, making the glowing purple crystals on its back stand out.
