# Howling Sands

Fish in Zone 2 would be **Desert & Oasis Extremophiles** (fish adapted to high temperatures, low oxygen, and mineral-rich or salty waters found in desert basins and canyon rivers).

> [!note] 
> **Desert Extremophiles** - Aquatic environments where fish survive in temperatures ranging from 25°C to 40°C, often inhabiting isolated springs, sun-baked rivers, or underground aquifers.

### Real world example
- **Pupfish:** Devils Hole Pupfish, Salt Creek Pupfish
- **Cichlids:** Tilapia variants, Desert Cichlids
- **Catfish:** Airbreathing Catfish, Walking Catfish
- **Barbs:** Desert Barbs
- **Gar:** Longnose Gar
- **Killifish:** Various "annual" fish that survive dry seasons

# Angler's Almanac concepts

### Sand-Sifter Cichlid
(**Inspiration**: African Cichlid)
- **Look:** A hardy, diamond-shaped body with vertical "heat-shimmer" stripes. It has a tough, leathery texture and a shovel-like lower jaw used to dig through the sandy riverbeds of the Howling Sands.

### Canyon Sinker
(**Inspiration**: Walking Catfish)
- **Look:** A heavy, armoured catfish with wide, flat fins that allow it to "stick" to canyon walls against rushing flash floods. Its skin is rough like sandstone, providing perfect camouflage against the desert rock.

### Mirage Fin
(**Inspiration**: Glass Catfish)
- **Look:** A small, delicate fish with semi-transparent scales that refract light like a desert mirage. When it moves, it creates a "heat haze" effect, making it difficult for predators to track.

## Zone 2 Cave
Deep beneath the dunes, ancient aquifers hold fish that have been isolated for millennia. These fish are often like living fossils with prehistoric features.

### Ancient Lungfish
(**Inspiration**: West African Lungfish)
- **Look:** A long, eel-like body with primitive, limb-like fins. It is covered in thick, plate-like scales that look like weathered pottery. It can survive in the thickest cave mud, moving slowly with a rhythmic, heavy pulse.
- 
### Fossil-Scale Goby
(**Inspiration**: Desert Goby)
- **Look:** A small, stout fish with a massive head. Its body is covered in calcified white scales that resemble desert fossils. Its eyes have evolved into glowing golden orbs to detect heat signatures in the cool underground springs.

### Aquifer Sentinel
(**Inspiration**: Blind Cave Eel)
- **Look:** An extremely long, thin white eel with glowing, vein-like patterns that map out its nervous system. It has no fins, moving like a snake through the narrow cracks of the deep desert aquifers.
