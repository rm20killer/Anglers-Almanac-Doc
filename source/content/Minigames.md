Don't like the minigames you can turn them off, even the whole minigame system.

## Games

| Minigame    | Name                 | Description                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tension Bar | Stardew Style        | Keep a floating bar over a moving fish icon.                     |
| Rhythm      | Fish Fish Revolution | Press WASD/Arrows in time with music or prompts.                 |
| Precision   | Timing               | A moving needle on a dial. Click in the "Sweet Spot."            |
| Struggle    | Button Masher        | Rapidly click to pull a heavy fish closer before the line snaps. |

Each minigame calculates a **Performance Percentage ($0\%$ to $100\%$)**, which is then mapped to the four grades: **Fail, Good, Great, and Perfect.**

### The Performance Mapping
Regardless of the minigame type, the final percentage is categorized like this:

| **Final Score (%)** | **Grade**   | **Reward Impact**                               |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Below 40%**       | **Fail**    | Line snaps; fish escapes (get Junk or nothing). |
| **40% – 79%**       | **Good**    | Standard catch (the fish you hooked).           |
| **80% – 94%**       | **Great**   | **25% chance** to upgrade rarity.               |
| **95% – 100%**      | **Perfect** | **50% chance** to upgrade rarity + Bonus Item?  |
