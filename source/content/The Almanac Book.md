As you catch fish, the book fills with sketches, data, and secrets, turning a simple hobby into a research project. Think [Dragon Manual](https://bookofdragons.github.io/) from How to Train Your Dragons but you fill the info when you catch the fish.

## Features
- **Zone Progress:** Track your completion percentage for all the zones.
- **Live Player Stats:** A page showing your current stats like **Luck**, **Size**, and **Focus** multipliers.
## How the Book Works
When you first start your game, the pages are mostly blank silhouettes. You must discover fish to unlock their secrets.
#### **1**: The First Catch
- **Name & Model:** Replaces the silhouette with a 3D view of the fish.
- **Description:** Unlocks the lore and description.
- **Habitat Info:** Reveals where to find it *(Biomes, Depth, and Y-Level)*.
#### **2**: Multiple Catches
- **Catch Counter:** Displays exactly how many of this species you have caught.
- **Variant Gallery:** Shows the different possible **Colour Palettes**.
- **Record Tracking:** Displays your Personal Best (Largest) and Smallest catches.
#### **3**: Mastery
- **Technical Stats:** Reveals the fish's Behaviour (Heavy, Darting, etc.) and Difficulty.
